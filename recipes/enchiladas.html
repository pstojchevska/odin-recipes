        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>¼ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon taco seasoning</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups enchilada sauce</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons chili powder</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>8 flour tortillas</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained</li>
            <li>¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cook and stir ground beef with onion in a skillet over medium heat until meat is crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain grease. Stir 1 cup Cheddar cheese, sour cream, parsley, taco seasoning, oregano, and black pepper into the ground beef until cheese has melted. Mix in enchilada sauce, chili powder, garlic, and salt; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and simmer until meat sauce is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lay a tortilla onto a work surface and spoon about 1/4 cup of meat sauce down the center of the tortilla. Top meat sauce with 1 tablespoon black beans and a sprinkling of black olives. Roll the tortilla up, enclosing the filling, and lay seam-side down into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Spoon any remaining meat sauce over the enchiladas and scatter any remaining black beans and black olives over the top. Sprinkle tortillas with 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese topping is melted and enchiladas and sauce are bubbling, 20 to 22 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.</li>
